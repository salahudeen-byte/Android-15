• When you first set up when connecting to WI-FI, when you enter the password, click on the arrow to go to the WI-FI network settings, there select the Mac address of the phone, and that's it, the phone will immediately connect to the desired WI-FI.
• The firmware is created for review only and is not optimized for everyday use. Read the spoiler "Additions" to know all the nuances.


Additions
Bugs :
• DPI (It can change to unusable values)
• Fingerprint
• Brightness slider does not work
• Face unlock
• The top panel (Where the battery, notifications, etc. are shown) is shifted and oddly cut off
• A black screen may appear during the first setup. If this happens, reboot the phone and before the black screen appears, you should have time to select a language. After selecting the language, there will be a black screen again, but it will go away after a while.
• The initial wallpaper is black for some reason
• The power button works with a delay
• If there are any more bugs, write to me and I will add them.
Add. Information :
• Long loading (2-5 minutes)
• No Google Play (G-Services are available, GP can be downloaded from AppMarket)
• Almost no blur (generally throughout the system)
• No parallel animations
• The phone is quite hot during use
• No built-in camera application
• The memory is initially very full, and also fills up quite quickly during use
• It is unlikely that version 2/16 will handle it, I advise you to install it on the version with 32/64GB memory

Installation method

I recommend using this TWRP:
Attached filerecovery.img (27.28 MB)

• Flash System Extender (Repartritioner_7GB)
• Flash Zip firmware file
• Flash Boot.img to boot partition
• Flash kernel (4.19.272-mi8937+.zip)
• Flash Magisk (if needed)
• Flash Appender V4
• Format Data via yes
• Reboot to system
